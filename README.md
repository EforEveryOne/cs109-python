This is a text-based adventure game designed by Elijah Friedrich for a class at Hampshire College: CS109-Intro to Programming Open Source.

Language: Python v3.6
IDLE or another program that is able to run the Python language.

The game will launch and run the start() function as soon as the program is run. 
It (the console) will stay open as long as the player is alive!
If using a text editor, the game will simply break out of the game loop but technically with the editor still open you can input commands and keep the game going...

The game starts by building the player character based on the user's input.
Once the character is made the player is brought into the game and is free to travel between scenes and advance their character by defeating monsters.

The game is very bare bones for now because it's still in early stages of development. The main purpose is to serve as a playground/project for me to improve my coding knowledge.
